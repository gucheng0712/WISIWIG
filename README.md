# WISIWYG
An immersive interactive installation project that combines visual arts and artificial intelligence.The installation creates interactive artwork and written descriptions by analyzing facial expressions and behavior.Finally, the color and shape of a flowing curve are used to represent the information of the interactor, and then saved into the whole scene.As the number of interactions increases, the scene will become a beautiful scene, called weiss's wig.In this project, we used machine learning algorithms to train artificial neural network models based on the Getty museum's art collection.In addition, we use data from emotions, age, gender, and how they interact with the screen to create real-time generated graphics.
